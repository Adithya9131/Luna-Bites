        <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2024, Luna Bites was born out of a passion for reviving traditional recipes and giving them a modern identity. Inspired by Chandrakanthalu, a cherished Andhra sweet, we reimagined it in unique flavors to cater to global palates.</p>
        <p>What started as a college project soon gained recognition for its fusion of flavors, leading us to establish Luna Bites as a brand that celebrates both culture and creativity.</p>
        <p>Today, we stand as a symbol of authenticity, offering handcrafted treats that bring people together under the magic of the moon.</p>

        <h2>Message from Our CEO </h2>
        <p>Food is more than just nourishment; it is tradition, culture, and emotion. At Luna Bites, we believe in sharing the warmth of Andhra Pradesh’s heritage with the world. Inspired by the moon’s glow and the spirit of togetherness, our Chandrakanthalu bites bring an age-old delicacy to the vibrant streets of Mexico, blending tradition with new flavors.</p>
        <p>Mexico and India share a deep-rooted love for food, family, and festivities. We honor this connection by crafting each bite with authenticity, ensuring that every Luna Bite carries the rich legacy of Andhra’s culinary artistry while embracing the bold and exciting palates of Mexico. Whether you savor our Classic Chandrakanthalu, the Spiced Mexican Fusion, or our Chocolate Moon Bites, each piece tells a story of tradition meeting innovation.

        <p>We invite you to be a part of our journey—one bite at a time...</p>
