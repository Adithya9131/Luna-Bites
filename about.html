        <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2024, Luna Bites was born out of a passion for reviving traditional recipes and giving them a modern identity. Inspired by Chandrakanthalu, a cherished Andhra sweet, we reimagined it in unique flavors to cater to global palates.</p>
        <p>What started as a college project soon gained recognition for its fusion of flavors, leading us to establish Luna Bites as a brand that celebrates both culture and creativity.</p>
        <p>Today, we stand as a symbol of authenticity, offering handcrafted treats that bring people together under the magic of the moon.</p>
